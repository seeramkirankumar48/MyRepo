length is just a parameter in the Array.
In java it is always pass by value only.
A base class is called superclass and the class which is inheriting that is called subclass.
A subclass can inherit all the methods and instance variables from the super class.
If a subclass has its own functionality then it can override the base class methods.(the instance variables of the super class are not overridden).
To know if you've designed your types correctly, ask "Does it make sense to say type X is-a type Y"
Inheritance is an "IS-A" relationship.
Triangle is a shape but the reverse (shape is a Triangle is not true)
if X IS-A Y (x->y) then X can do all the things that Y can do.
you can invoke the super class method by super.method()
